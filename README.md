DPS Main Web Page
Project Description:
For my 10th standard project, I undertook the task of creating a simple webpage for Delhi Public School, BPKIHS. The goal of the project was to develop a user-friendly and informative webpage that would serve as a virtual platform for the school, providing essential information and engaging content for visitors.

Features:
The webpage briefly describes the history and information of the school. It also provides a hyperlink directing to the website of Delhi Public School, BPKIHS, Dharan, Nepal(dpsbpkihsdharan.org) for additional information related to admission, transportation, managing committee, etc.

Development Tools:
For the development of the webpage, I used HTML and CSS to build the frontend. Additionally, I leveraged online resources and tutorials to enhance my coding skills and deliver a polished final product.
